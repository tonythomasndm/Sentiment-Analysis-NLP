# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP

Social media analytics is the practice of gathering data from social media websites and analyzing that data
using social media analytics tools to make business decisions or for research.

Sentiment Analysis- you are supplied with a phrase, or a list of phrases and your classifier is supposed
to tell if the sentiment behind that is positive, negative or neutral.

In this I have prepared a Sentiment Analyser which will gather data from twitter and will analyse the sentiment behind it 
Here we have used the concept of Naive Bayes Probability theroem

You can try out the "NaiveBayesSA" program file and check how this actually works using a sample file "movie_reviews"

To use my twitter tweet classifier
1.Download the file "TwitterSA.py"
2.Install the necessary libraries 
3.Fill in the information in "XXX-XX..."
4.Run the Program 
5.It will successfully classify the tweets as positive,negative or neutral on the output screen

Sample Output :
